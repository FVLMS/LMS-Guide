      <h1>Minnesota Paid Leave — Eligibility</h1>
      <p><strong>Eligibility rule:</strong> Only employees who work at least 50% of their time in Minnesota — including remote work, mobile roles, or on-site at a Fairview/Ebenezer location — are eligible for Paid Leave. You are not covered if you work more than 50% of your time in a different state.</p>

<h1>Minnesota Paid Leave</h1>
<p>Minnesota Paid Leave provides payments and job protections when you need time off to care for yourself or your family.</p>
<p>You can take leave for the following qualifying events:</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Medical Leave:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To care for your own serious health condition, including care related to pregnancy, childbirth, and recovery</li>
</ul>
<h3>Family Leave:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bonding Leave &ndash; to care for and bond with a child welcomed through birth, adoption, or foster placement</li>
<li>Caring Leave &ndash; to care for a family member with a serious health condition</li>
<li>Military Family Leave &ndash; to support a family member called to active duty</li>
<li>Safety Leave &ndash; to respond to issues related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking for yourself or a family member</li>
</ul>
<h2>Am I covered by Paid Leave?</h2>
<p>Most workers in Minnesota are covered by Paid Leave. You are covered no matter the size of your employer, or the hours or days you work. Independent contractors and self-employed individuals are not automatically covered, but may opt in. You may qualify for payments if you&rsquo;ve been paid a minimum amount for work in Minnesota in the last year ($3,900 for the start of Paid Leave in 2026).</p>
<h2>What are my employment protections?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Job protections:</strong> Generally, you must be restored to your job or an equivalent position when returning from leave. Job protections take effect 90 days after your date of hire.</li>
<li><strong>Health insurance continuation:</strong> Generally, employers must continue to fund their portion of healthcare insurance and other group insurance premiums while you are on leave. You will be responsible for any portion of health insurance and other group insurance premiums that you pay.</li>
<li><strong>No retaliation or interference:</strong> Employers must not interfere with or retaliate against you if you apply for or use Paid Leave. Employers cannot take your Paid Leave payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>For inquiries related to Paid Leave, please contact Minnesota Paid Leave at 651-556-7777 or visit our website. If you think your employer is violating employment protections, contact the Labor Standards Division at the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry.</p>
<h2>Who pays for Paid Leave?</h2>
<p>Paid Leave is funded by premiums paid by employees and employers. <strong>The initial premium rate is 0.88% of wages</strong> up to the cap set by Social Security&rsquo;s Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program (currently $176,000). Your employer <strong>may deduct up to 0.44% of your wages</strong> to fund your portion of the premium.&nbsp; This total premium covers both Medical Leave (0.61%) and Family Leave (0.27%).</p>
<p>Employers are responsible for sending premiums to Paid Leave on behalf of all employees.</p>
<p>Your premium contributions are:</p>
